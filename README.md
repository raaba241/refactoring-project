# Refactoring-Project ReadME


## Description

This project was done to understand how to use better semantics and properly incorporate comments throughout the code. This made the existing website more accessible and easy to understand. Although comments are great to use, sometimes we can go overboard, so I've learnt to cut back and comment when needed.
